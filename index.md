You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alavrouk/LoL-data/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

# League of Legends - Predicting Match Outcomes with Machine Learning

## _Anton Lavrouk (Georgia Tech '24)_
## _Ethan Jiang (Vanderbilt University '24)_

## **OVERVIEW**
Using only pre-match data, this project uses machine learning to try and predict the outcome of League of Legends Champion's Queue matches. 

etc. etc.

### A Quick Summary - League of Legends Champion's Queue
Champion's Queue intends to offer top NA & LATAM players a competitive environment closer to those found in KR and Chinese servers by
1. limiting player pool to pro and select semi-pro players and
2. lowering game ping.

### Data Collection & Usage
Champion's Queue is currently in **Summer Split 1** (as of today, 18 June 2022). Since League of Legends underwent a [significant rebalancing](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-12-10-notes/) right before the start of this split, our models are <ins>trained exclusively on matches from this split</ins>.

## **ALGORITHMS**

### Random Forest

### Neural Network

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Clustering

- _K-Means_
- _Gaussian Mixture Models_
- _K-Nearest Neighbors_
