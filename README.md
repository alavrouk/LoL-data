# What is this?

This is a summer project by Anton Lavrouk (Georgia Tech '24) and Ethan Jiang (Vanerbilt '24). We aim to predict matches from the prestigious **CHampions Queue** recently implemented in the popular online game League of Legends. More information can be found at https://alavrouk.github.io/LoL-data/

# Running the models.

After cloning the repo, run the code using:

```bash
python3 ChampionsQueueModel.py
```

This will provide you with a CLI that gives you the option of re-scraping data from ![championsqueue.gg](championsqueue.gg), as well as your choice of algorithm from the ones imported.
