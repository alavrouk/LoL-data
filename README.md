# What is this?

This is a summer project by Anton Lavrouk (Georgia Tech '24) and Ethan Jiang (Vanerbilt '24). We aim to predict matches from the prestigious **Champions Queue** recently implemented in the popular online game League of Legends. More information can be found at https://alavrouk.github.io/LoL-data/

# Running the models

After cloning the repo, run the code using:

```bash
python3 ChampionsQueueModel.py
```

This will provide you with a CLI that gives you the option of re-scraping data from ![championsqueue.gg](championsqueue.gg), as well as your choice of algorithm from the ones implemented. 

# TLDR

We implemented a few common machine learning models/algorithms in order to try to predict matches just based on which players are playing the match and what champions (heroes/characters/whatever you are familiar with) they picked. We ended up with about an 80% accuracy from the best performing model, the neural network. Pretty cool stuff!
